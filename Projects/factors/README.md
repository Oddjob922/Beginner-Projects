### Factors of a Number
- Define a function that creates a list of all the numbers that are factors of the user's number.
- For example, if the function is called factor, factor(36) should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36].
- The numbers in your list should be sorted from least to greatest, and 1 and the original number should be included.
- Remember to consider negative numbers as well as 0.
- Bonus:
  - Have the program print the factors of the users number in a comma separated string, without a comma after the last number, and without the brackets of a Python list.
  - If the user's number is prime, note it.
