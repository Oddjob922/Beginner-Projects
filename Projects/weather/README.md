### Whatâ€™s the Weather?
If you would like to know the basics of what an API is, check out [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/qowts/eli5_what_is_api/c3z9kok) post by iamapizza.
- Create a program that pulls data from OpenWeatherMap.org and prints out information about the current weather, such as the high, the low, and the amount of rain for wherever you live.
- Subgoals:
  - Print out data for the next 5-7 days so you have a 5 day/week long forecast.
  - Print the data to another file that you can open up and view at, instead of viewing the information in the command line.
  - If you know html, write a file that you can print information to so that your project is more interesting. Here is an example of the results from what I threw together.[3]
- Tips:
  - APIs that are in Json are essentially lists and dictionaries. Remember that to reference something in a list, you must refer to it by what number element it is in the list, and to reference a key in a dictionary, you must refer to it by it's name.
  - Don't like Celsius? Add &units=imperial to the end of the URL of the API to receive your data in Fahrenheit.
