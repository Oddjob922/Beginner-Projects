### Fibonacci Sequence
If you do not know about the Fibonacci Sequence, read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).
- Define a function that allows the user to find the value of the nth term in the sequence.
- To make sure you've written your function correctly, test the first 10 numbers of the sequence.
- You can assume either that the first two terms are 0 and 1 or that they are both 1.
